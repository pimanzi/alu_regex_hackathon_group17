## Description

In response to a February 2024 assignment called alu_regex_hackathon for first-year ALU students in their third term, our group opted to develop a straightforward web page. For this project, we integrated regular expressions using JavaScript to enhance the functionality of our chosen web application.

## Functionality Overview

our webpage contains a simple form, whereby we integrated in regular exxpressions,

### How it works

This is our webpage

The image illustrates that when you input a value in the correct format, matching the defined regular expression for a specific field, a green border is displayed to indicate that there are no errors.

![third-img](images/api3.png)

The image illustrates that when you input a value in the wrong format, not matching the defined regular expression for a specific field, a red border is displayed that there are errors in your format.

![fourth-img](images/api4.png)

he image displays the console output following an incorrect input format that does not match the specified regular expression for a particular field. It reveals an error message indicating the incorrect format and promptly provides an example illustrating the correct formatting for the input.
